# Demo Code for 301n14

## Steps
1. git init
2. Create a readme
3. ran npm init (used server.js instead of index.js)
4. added gitignore and eslint.json (from workshop)
5. Write out a basic server file (based off of our workshop on class 05)
    - run the server with `node server.js`
    - install any dependencies
6. create a custom JSON file (only if you don't already have one)
7. Create new route to consume the json file
8. Use `nodemon` to watch for changes on our server side. 
    - You will need to install `nodemon`. This can be done globally.
